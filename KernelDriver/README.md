# Hardware-Level HWID Spoofer - Kernel Driver Approach

## Overview
This approach uses a Windows kernel driver to intercept hardware identification queries at the system level, providing deeper spoofing than registry modifications.

## How It Works

### 1. Kernel Driver Components
```
Driver.sys (Kernel Mode)
├── SMBIOS Table Interception
├── WMI Query Hooking  
├── Registry Virtualization
├── Hardware ID Filtering
└── Boot-Time Initialization
```

### 2. Spoofing Targets
- **SMBIOS Tables**: Motherboard, BIOS, CPU identifiers
- **WMI Queries**: Hardware management interface
- **Device Manager**: PCI/USB device IDs
- **System Calls**: Hardware enumeration APIs

### 3. Installation Process
1. **Boot Integration**: Driver loads during Windows boot
2. **Kernel Hooks**: Intercepts hardware queries
3. **Memory Patching**: Modifies in-memory hardware data
4. **Persistent Storage**: Saves spoofed values

## Implementation Requirements

### Development Tools Needed
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
- Visual Studio with kernel development
- Test signing certificate
- Virtual machine for testing

### Technical Challenges
- **Driver Signing**: Windows requires signed drivers
- **HVCI/VBS**: Modern security features block unsigned drivers
- **Anti-Cheat Detection**: Advanced games detect kernel modifications
- **System Stability**: Kernel bugs can cause BSOD

## Effectiveness Comparison

| Method | Registry | Kernel Driver | BIOS Mod |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|
| Software Tools | 70% | 95% | 100% |
| Hardware Tools | 20% | 85% | 100% |
| Anti-Cheat | 30% | 90% | 100% |
| Risk Level | Low | Medium | High |

## Legal & Safety Warnings

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS**
- Kernel drivers can cause system instability
- Unsigned drivers require test mode or signing
- May violate software license agreements
- Can trigger anti-virus detection
- Risk of permanent system damage

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Hypervisor-Based Spoofing
- Run Windows in virtual machine
- Spoof hardware at hypervisor level
- Requires virtualization knowledge

### 2. EFI/UEFI Applications
- Boot-time spoofing before OS loads
- Modifies system tables in memory
- Requires UEFI development skills

### 3. Hardware Emulation
- Physical device with spoofed identifiers
- USB/PCIe devices with custom firmware
- Most expensive but most effective
